// This is about changing the stack pointer
// Shoves a MIPS instruction into near the very top of the entry point
// Ghidra blows up here, but binary ninja can handle it
// Orginally at this position there is `2D E8 40 00` - `daddu $sp, $v0, $zero`
// This changes it to - `lui sp, 0x0800` Which loads the value 0x0800 to the stackpointer register, modifying it.

// Change DebugBootMessage from `demo` to `play`.
patch=0,EE,00127610,word,79616c70

// The level that the game wants to load on startup with 'play' DebugBootMessage is missing. Getting around this problem with DebugBootLevel is not a correct solution, since it modifies how the game looks for DGO files - making most levels unreachable.
// It is possible to tell the game to load a different DGO instead of the missing one. The patches below will make the game load 'DEMO.DGO' instead of 'PRI.DGO'.
// This is the only level that it wants on startup - the game will work fine now, but you will spawn in the void. Just use the Debug Menu to escape.
